# OverTheWire-Bandit-Writeup

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is a site that offers wargames for you to learn security concepts through hands-on exercises.
[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is a wargame for complete beginners, not only teaching basic IT and Linux concepts, but also how to do your own research.

Here are some things I recommend for those completely starting from scratch:

1. Use a Linux VM(virtual machine). If you're completely new, I recommend setting up [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) or [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Don't immediately look up solutions/writeups. First, try to Google things like the **Commands you may need to solve this level** section.
3. Save your passwords, or you'll have to do the levels all over again. Just keep in mind that you should **_NEVER_** share passwords for the wargames.
4. **Document** your attempts. Even jotting down simple notes can help you later on!
5. Have fun!
