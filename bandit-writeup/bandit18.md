## Level Goal

> There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**

Yes, there is a pretty simple way to compare one file to another. <br>
`diff passwords.new passwords.old` (You'll want the top one)
