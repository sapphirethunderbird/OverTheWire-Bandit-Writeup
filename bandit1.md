# Bandit 1

## Level goal

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

This is where you will take your first steps with the Linux command line. It looks scary if this is your first time, but you'll eventually get used to it.

Make sure you're logged in as `bandit0` on the server.
You need to find the file called `readme` in the home directory. Since you are already in the home directory when you log in, all you need to do is look around.
You can do this with `ls`.

You should get something like `readme` in the response. Now, you need to open the file.
You can do this with `cat`.

You should now have a congratulations message and the password.
