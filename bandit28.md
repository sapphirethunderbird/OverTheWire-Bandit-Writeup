# Bandit 28

## Level Goal

> There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit27-git` is the same as for the user `bandit27`.
> Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

You'll need to make a directory in `tmp` in order to copy the file. Then, you need to `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo`. The password is in the README.
